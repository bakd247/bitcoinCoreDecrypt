This Program is intended to decrpyt encrypted Private Keys found in Bitcoin Core and like Wallets that use AES-256-CBC specifically.
This version works with python 3...
Simply replace the feilds in the code with you passphrase, salt, iteration count, public key and encrypted master and private keys and it will return a decrypted masterkey and a decrypted private key.
This code has been checked against multiple Bitcoin and LItecoin core wallets and indeed works if the information is entered in the feilds correctly.
